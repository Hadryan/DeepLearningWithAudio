Two Jupyter Notebooks that demonstrate some small examples with machine learning and audio. To run them, execute ```jupyter notebook``` in a terminal within this repository.

* ```Activation functions.ipynb``` shows how different activation functions affect raw audio arrays.
* ```Audio Classification.ipynb``` demonstrates a simple Convolutional Network for classifiying sound files in the raw audio domain.
