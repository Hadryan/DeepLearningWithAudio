''' These are tools for loading arbitrary sets of wav files to use with machine learning. It turns wav files into numpy arrays that are good to input into models.
 Also, saves the numpy arrays on disk, so on the next run it can load the numpy arrays directly without needing to do a lot of conversion work.

Load audio loads audio from multiple folders and labels them according to the folder name. It does a 80-20 train-test split on the data.
Returns 4 arrays:
 X_train: Array of wav files in sample form as a numpy array. 80% of the data
 Y_train: Labels for X_Train, to train categorization.
 X_test: Array of wav files in sample form as a numpy array. 20% of the data
 Y_test: Labels for X_Test, to test categorization.

Attributes:
 foldername: Which folder under input to look into
 num_classes: How many folders within the main folder do we get examples from
 framerate: Changes the frame rate of the sound. Not very reliable currently.
 forceLoad: Do we ignore any previously saved version of the data and reload all of it.
 reshape: Do we reshape the data so that it fits better in a regular tensor.

 NOTE: The system also pads any sound to the longest length in the set. So try to get sounds of roughly the same length.
