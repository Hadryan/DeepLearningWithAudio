# AudioMNIST
- Tools for loading, playing and plotting audio.
- Some working simple classifiers
- Non-working sample-level GANs
- Python scripts for sorting different popular datasets

All of these are meant to work as starting points or aids for audio machine learning, but many of the examples are still very rudimentary and might not produce any meaningful results.
